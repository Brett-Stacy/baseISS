paper_scenario_2.1 - Same as 1.1 except NULL expansion.
paper_scenario_3.1 - Same as 1.1 except NULL expand by sampling strata.
paper_scenario_4.1 - Same as 1.1 except NULL expansion and NULL expand by sampling strata.
paper_scenario_5.1 - Same as 1.1 except NULL expansion and NULL expand by sampling strata and NULL boot.trip and NULL boot.haul.
paper_scenario_6.1 - Same as 5.1 except ADD back expansion. (no expand by sampling strata or boot)
